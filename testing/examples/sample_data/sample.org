* Data Analysis
** Results Overview

The analysis shows promising results across all samples.

| Sample | Value | Result |
|--------+-------+--------|
| A      |   100 | Pass   |
| B      |    85 | Pass   |

We used a three-stage approach:

1. Data collection
2. Statistical analysis
3. Validation

*** Sample Collection

Samples were collected from three different sources.

- Source A: Primary dataset
- Source B: Validation dataset
- Source C: Control group

*** Analysis Process

The analysis followed standard procedures.

#+begin_src python
def analyze_data(samples):
    results = []
    for sample in samples:
        if sample.value >= 50:
            results.append("Pass")
        else:
            results.append("Fail")
    return results
